 It all started 1992, only two years after Cameroon had conquered the hearts of football lovers worldwide with the legendary goal celebration dance of Roger Milla and his teammates at the World Cup. As the Cameroonian student community grew, a small group coming from three different cities of Germany decided to meet and take up the challenge of organizing a football tournament in Bielefeld. This tournament was the starting point of the “Challenge Camerounais” event, simply known as “Challenge”. This was followed by the registration of the event as a nonprofit association in 2002. Since then, the association is called Challenge Camerounais e.V. (CC.e.V.)
